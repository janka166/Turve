# Malware
Overview
This educational project demonstrates ransomware functionality by developing a program that encrypts files with a custom extension and creates a desktop notification. 
The implementation generates a random encryption key for each victim and provides a corresponding decryption program using the same key.

## Understanding Ransomware
Ransomware is malicious software designed to block access to computer systems or data, typically through file encryption,
until a ransom payment is made. Modern ransomware variants target various file types—including personal documents,
photos, and databases—effectively holding them hostage. These programs typically display ransom notes containing payment
instructions for file recovery.

## Ransomware Implementation Details
The provided ransomware operates through three primary phases:

1. Key Generation and Storage
- Generates an encryption key using the Fernet cryptography library

- Stores the key in a secret.key file for future decryption

- Reuses existing keys if present, enabling file recovery after payment

2. File Encryption Process

- Encrypts all files within the target directory (./test)

- Skips files already bearing the .malware extension

- Renames encrypted files with the .malware extension

- Deletes original files to prevent access without decryption

3. Ransom Notification

- Creates a README.txt file on the user's desktop

- Provides encryption notification and payment contact information

## Decryption Program Functionality
The decryption utility operates as follows:

1. Key Retrieval

- Loads the encryption key from the secret.key file

- Requires the same key used during encryption

2. File Restoration

- Scans the directory for .malware extension files

- Decrypts each file using the retrieved key

- Restores original filenames by removing the .malware extension

- Deletes encrypted versions after successful decryption

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Ransomware Definition: The scripts clearly demonstrate core ransomware characteristics—file encryption and ransom demands

- Anti-Virus Evasion: While the basic implementation doesn't include advanced evasion techniques, the concept highlights how encryption-based malware can bypass signature detection

- Operational Clarity: Both encryption and decryption processes are transparently implemented for educational analysis
